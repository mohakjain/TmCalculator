[10/02/2013]Marine Dumousseau (marine@ebi.ac.uk)
Thanks to Richard Owczarzy:
	Fixed typos in some thermodynamic parameters:
	- bom00 model. GA/C- parameters are dH = -2.1 kcal/mol and dS = -3.9 in the paper
	- san05 inosing model. Paramaters rounded to -6.0 kcal/mol. The paper reports -5.6 kcal/mol enthalpy.
	- xia98 model. Parameters rounded into -6.8 kcal/mol. published -6.82 kcal/mol
    - san04 bulge loop model. The sign of the entropy parameters are wrong.
    - ser08 dangling ends model. The sign of some parameters (5' dangling ends) are wrong.

	parameters.

	Second beta version. Correction of some NN files. Modifications of
	documentation.

	hybridisations. Correction of a bug in the screening of
	Crick'pair.

[24/JAN/2000] Nicolas Le Novère (nl223@cus.cam.ac.uk)

	alpha5. The program can now read a file containing the
	nearest-neighbor parameters for some mismatched Crick's pairs.

[18/JAN/2000] Nicolas Le Novère (nl223@cus.cam.ac.uk) 

	on suggestion of Nicolas Joly (njoly@pasteur.fr) alpha3 and
	alpha4. Code correction only.
	
[17/JAN/2000] Nicolas Le Novère (nl223@cus.cam.ac.uk)

	alpha2. Modified the system to localize files containing set of nn
	parameters. Now a directory is defined at compilation by
	preprocessor directive. However, an environment variable can be
	defined, which targets a directory where to find a nn file. If it
	was not found there, it will be searched in the default
	directory. Therefore, a user can define its own set of parameters,
	while still using those installed with melting.
