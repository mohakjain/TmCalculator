[INSTALLATION]

Unbundle the distribution in the proper place (e.g. /usr/local/ or c:\Program
Files). 

Some pre-compiled binaries are located in the directory bin. The program just needs 
a Java 1.5 environment (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp).

If you want to build this project, you need to have ant installed on your system (
http://ant.apache.org). When this is done, you just need to type buildProject.sh.
The resulting classes will be in ./build/src, the resulting jar in ./build/lib and
the generated Javadoc in ./build/javadoc.

UNICES 

Type `sudo Install.unice' to install the program.
The manpage melting.1 is moved in the proper location during the
installation. The other files can stay in doc or the entire doc directory can be
moved under the name melting in /usr/doc or an equivalent directory.
Be aware : the Install.unice script is for ubuntu, check if the executable and the 
Data are moved in the proper place. The melting5.jar is moved with the executable
in /usr/local/bin.

WINDOWS

The documentation is located in the directory doc. The files containing the nearest-neighbor
parameters are located in the directory Data.

[EXECUTION]

READ THE DOCUMENTATION BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM. 

The executable versions do not require any particular external libraries, 
and must run directly. 
Go to the directory executables (contains the executable) and type 
'melting.bat [options]' under DOS/Windows (or 'melting4.bat [options]' if you
want to use MELTING 5 with the options of MELTING 4. Be aware, using MELTING 5 with the options
of MELTING 4 doesn't allow the user to change some of the thermodynamic models and corrections.
In addition to that, the user can't enter a formamide or DMSO %). 
Type 'melting [options]' under Unixes (or 'melting4 [options]' if you
want to use MELTING 5 with the options of MELTING 4. Be aware, using MELTING 5 with the options
of MELTING 4 doesn't allow the user to change some of the thermodynamic models and corrections.
In addition to that, the user can't enter a formamide or DMSO %).  

You can also put the executable in a directory present in your PATH 
variable in order to use the programme wherever you are. The environment 
variable NN_PATH can be set to the directory containing your personal 
nearest-neighbor parameters. For instance in the bash:

export NN_PATH=$HOME/LIB/MELTING/Data (UNIX)
set NN_PATH=%USERPROFILE%/MELTING/Data (WINDOWS)

In a graphical environment you can also launch melting by clicking on an 
icon linked to the program (the command-line options can then be entered 
through the properties of the icon, generally in the 'execute' or 'run' 
entry).

Type 'melting -h' to get a summary of options.

The directory testResults contains files with measured Tm from the literature.
They are useful only for testing the different sets of NN, the corrections
of salt concentration etc.
