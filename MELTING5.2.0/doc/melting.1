.TH MELTING 1 "2009 July 13" "Debian GNU/Linux" "Melting user-guide"
.SH NAME
melting \- nearest-neighbor computation of nucleic acid hybridation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B melting 
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Melting 
computes, for a nucleic acid duplex, the enthalpy and the entropy of the
helix-coil transition, and then its melting temperature.
Four types of hybridisation are possible: DNA/DNA, DNA/RNA, RNA/RNA and 2-O-Methyl RNA/RNA. 
The program uses the method of nearest-neighbors. The set of thermodynamic
parameters can be easely changed, for instance following an experimental 
breakthrough. Melting is a free program in both sense of the term. It comes 
with no cost and it is open-source. In addition it is coded in Java (1.5) and can be compiled 
on any operating system.
.SH OPTIONS
The options are treated sequentially. If there is a conflict between
the value of two options, the latter normally erases the former.

.SS Information about
.B Melting

.TP
.BI "\-h"
Displays a short help and quit.
.TP
.BI "\-L"
Prints the legal informations and quit.
.TP
.BI "\-V" 
Displays the version number and quit.
.TP
.BI "\-p"  
Return the directory supposed to contain the sets of calorimetric parameters and quit. 
If the environment variable NN\_PATH is set, it is returned. Otherwise, the value
defined by default during the compilation is returned.

.SS Mandatory options

.TP
.BI "\-S" "sequence"
Sequence of one strand of the nucleic acid duplex, entered 5' to 3'. 
IMPORTANT: Uridine and thymidine are not considered as identical. The bases can be upper or lowercase.
.TP
.BI "\-C" "sequence"
Enters the complementary sequence, from 3' to 5'. This option is mandatory if
there are mismatches, inosine(s) or hydroxyadenine(s) between the two strands. If it is not used, the program
will compute it as the complement of the sequence entered with the option 
.B \-S
In case of self complementary sequences, the programm can automatically detect the symmetry and deduce 
the complementary even though there is (are) dangling end(s) and it is not necessary to write the complementary 
sequence with the option
.B \-C
IMPORTANT: Uridine and thymidine are not considered as identical. The bases can be upper or lowercase.
.TP
.BI "\-E" "ion1_name=x.xxe-xx:ion2_name=x.xxe-xx:agent1_name=x.xxe-xx..."
Enters the different ion (Na, Mg, Tris, K) or agent (dNTP, DMSO, formamide) concentrations. The effect  
of  ions and denaturing agents on  thermodynamic  stability  of nucleic  acid duplexes is complex,
and the correcting functions are  at  best rough  approximations. All the concentrations must be positive numeric
values and in M. There are some exceptions for the DMSO concentrations (in percent) and the formamide concentrations
(in percent or M depending on the used correction method). Be aware, the [Tris+] is about half of the total tris buffer
concentration.
At least one cation concentration is mandatory, the other agents are optional. See the documentation for the concentration 
limits. It depends on the used correction.
.TP
.BI "\-P" "x.xxe-xx"
Concentration of the nucleic acid strand in excess. It must be a strict positive numeric value and it is mandatory. The oligomer
concentration is in M.
.TP
.BI "\-H" "hybridization_type"
Specifies the hybridisation type. Moreover this parameter determines the nature of the sequences entered by the user.
Possible values are :

dnadna : 
.br
DNA sequence (option
.B \-S
) and DNA complementary sequence (option
.B \-C
)

rnarna : 
.br
RNA sequence (option
.B \-S
) and RNA complementary sequence (option
.B \-C
)

dnarna : 
.br
DNA sequence (option
.B \-S
) and RNA complementary sequence (option
.B \-C
)

rnadna : 
.br
RNA sequence (option
.B \-S
) and DNA complementary sequence (option
.B \-C
)

mrnarna : 
.br
2-o-methyl RNA sequence (option
.B \-S
) and RNA complementary sequence (option
.B \-C
)

mrnarna : 
.br
RNA sequence (option
.B \-S
) and 2-o-methyl RNA complementary sequence (option
.B \-C
)

This option is mandatory to select the default equations and methods to use.

.SS General options

.TP
.BI "\-T" "xxx"
Size threshold before approximative computation. The nearest-neighbour approach 
will be used by default if the length of the sequence is inferior to this threshold,
otherwise it is the approximative approach which will be used by default.
.TP
.BI "\-v"
Activates the verbose mode, issuing a lot more information about the current run  (try it once 
to see if you can get something interesting).
.TP
.BI "\-nnpath" "folder_pathway"
Change the default pathway (Data) where to find the default calorimetric tables (thermodynamic parameters).
The program will look for the file in a directory specified during the installation.
However, if an environment variable NN_PATH is defined, melting will search in this one first.
.TP
.BI "\-O" "output_file"
The output is directed to this file instead of the standard output. The name of the file must be specified.
.TP
.BI "\-self"
To precise that the sequence entered with the option 
.B \-S
 is self complementary. No complementary sequence is mandatory. 
The program automatically can detect a self complementary sequence for perfect matching sequences or sequences with dangling ends. 
In these cases, the option 
.B \-self
 is not necessary. Otherwise we need to precise that the sequences are self complementary with this option. 
  examples:
  
  ###beginning###
.br   
- The sequence ATCGCGAT is self complementary. The option 
.B \-self
 is not necessary because the programm can automatically detect it.
.br
- The sequence -TCGCGAT is self complementary but with a single dangling end. The option 
.B \-self
 is not necessary because the programm can automatically detect it.
.br
- If the sequence ATCCCGAT is self complementary with a single mismatch (C/C), the option 
.B \-self
 is necessary to precise the self complementarity because the programm can't automatically detect it.

###end###
.TP
.BI "\-F" "xxx"
This is the correction factor used to modulate the effect of the nucleic acid concentration in the computation of the melting temperature. 
If the sequences are automatically recognized as self complementary sequences or if the option 
.B \-self
is used, the factor correction is automatically 1.
Otherwise F is 4 if the both strands are present in equivalent amount and 1 if one strand is in excess. The default factor value is 4. 
  
.SS Set of thermodynamic parameters and methods (models)
  
By default, the approximative mode is used for oligonucleotides longer than 60 bases (the default threshold value), otherwise the nearest 
neighbor model is used. 

.TP
.BI "\-am" "method_name"
Forces to use a specific approximative formula, based on G+C content. You can use one of the following :

DNA duplexes
.br
.I ahs01
(from von Ahsen et al. 2001)
.br
.I che93

If there is no formula name after the option 
.B \-am
, we will compute the melting temperature with the default approximative formula.
This option has to be used with caution. Note that such a calcul is increasingly incorrect when the length of  the duplex 
decreases. Moreover, it does not take into account nucleic acid concentration, which is a strong mistake.
examples :

  ###beginning###

- "-am" if you want to force the approximative approach with the default formula.
.br
- "-am ahs01" if you want to use the approximative formula from Ahsen et al. 2001.

.B \-nn
, we will compute the melting temperature with the default nearest neighbor model. 
Each nearest neighbor model uses a specific xml file containing the thermodynamic values. If you want to use another file, write the file name or the file pathway preceded by ':' (-nn [optionalname:optionalfile]).
examples:   

  ###beginning###
.br
- "-nn" if you want to force the nearest neighbor computation with the default model.
.br
- "-nn tan04" if you want to use the nearest neighbor model from Tanaka et al. 2004 with the thermodynamic parameters in the default xml file.

  ###beginning###
.br
- "-DMSO ahs01" if you want to force the use of the DMSO correction from Ahsen et al 2001. This DMSO correction will be used 
if there is DMSO present in the solutions in case of nearest neighbor approach and approximative approach. 

###end###
.TP
.BI "\-for" "method_name"
Forces to use a specific formamide correction.
You can use one of the following :
DNA duplexes}]
.br
.I bla96
(from Blake et al 1996) with formamide concentration in M  (by default)
.br
.I lincorr
(linear correction) with a percent of formamide volume		  	 

For the other types of hybridization, the DNA default correction is used but there is no guaranty of accuracy.
If there are formamide when an approximative approach is used, a formamide correction is automatically computed.
The correcting functions are  at  best rough  approximations.
example :

  ###beginning###
.br
- "-for lincorr" if you want to force the use of the linear formamide correction. This formamide correction will be used 
if there is formamide present in the solutions in case of nearest neighbor approach and approximative approach. 

###end###
